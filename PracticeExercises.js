// Exercise 1 (console.log, printing to console):

console.log('+--------+');
console.log('|        |');
console.log('|        |');
console.log('|        |');
console.log('+--------+');

// Exercise 2 (variables and data types):
// Store three integers into three variables, 
// write a program that will sum the 3 numbers together and store the result in a single variable 
// and output it. The final result should be printed to the terminal (standard output)

let var1 = 3;
let var2 = 4;
let var3 = 6;


console.log(var1 + var2 + var3);
 
//Exercise 3 (division operator and storing data):
// Using the knowledge you gained from the previous exercise, apply the division operator / on the 
// final result by the number of numbers you summed up. Make sure you output
// "The average is: <average>" Where <average> is a placeholder for the computed average.

let total = var1 + var2 + var3;

let average = total / 3;

console.log('The average is: ' + average);


// Exercise 4 (for loops, multiplication):
let i = 1;
for (let i = 0; i < 12; i++)
{

};
