<h1>Programming – ICTPRG302 – Client Interactive with Christina Kaiser</h1>
<h2>Transcript</h2>
<p class="desc">[The red waratah of the NSW Government logo and TAFE NSW logo appear on a grey background. A montage of images forms the letters ‘TAFE NSW’. An image in the centre of the montage takes full screen. It depicts Christina Kaiser, sitting in an office, a laptop in front of her. She smiles to camera. Text: CLIENT INTERACTIVE WITH CHRISTINA KAISER. 
Over a grey and blue background, a numeral 1. Text: INTERACTIVE TASK.]

<p class="desc">[Christina Kaiser sits in an office and faces the camera. A laptop is on the desk in front of her. On the wall behind her, is a framed certificate with her name and the Gelos Enterprises logo. She reaches out and mimes shaking the viewer’s hand.] </p>

Good morning, and thank you for agreeing to help with our programming project. As you know, we will need to create a small log-in program, and I feel this is the perfect type of project to further your training. </p>
<p>A software design document has been started, but you'll need to fill in the details. Also, as you create the program, enter the details for your design. </p>
<p>Would you require any additional information to get you started? </p>
<p class="desc">[Christina Kaiser tilts her head, smiles and raises her brows slightly. The screen blurs.

  Task One.]
  <p class="desc">[Text over a blue background: INTERACT WITH CHRISTINA KAISER – TASK 1. On the right-hand side of screen, are three icons, a pause symbol, a record symbol and a play symbol, each with text. The text reads: 1. PAUSE VIDEO. 2. RECORD YOUR RESPONSE. 3. PRESS PLAY FOR NEXT TASK.   
  Over a grey and blue background, a numeral 2. Text: INTERACTIVE TASK. 
  Christina Kaiser returns to screen.]

We're planning to use this piece of login code in a variety of applications. We will eventually require it to be written in other languages. </p>
<p>Don't worry, though. I only need you to create one at the moment. </p>
<p>One purpose for this login is for a game in Unreal Engine, so we'd be happy for you to use C++. Or you can also code in Python for use with other applications. </p>
<p>I know you are currently being trained in programming, so happy for you to use whichever coding language you are currently training in, and we'll worry about the other scripts further down the track. </p>
<p>What else can I help you with? </p><p class="desc">[VOICEOVER:

<p> <span class="speaker">CHRISTINA KAISER: </span>
We would like the user to be able to enter a password of their choice or to randomly generate one. The user should have the option to generate a password which is made up of letters, numbers, or symbols, with a choice on which of these they use. </p>
<p>Is there anything else you need to know about the passwords? </p>

<p><span class="speaker">CHRISTINA KAISER: </span>
Good question. The default password length should be 10 characters, but I think we should also give the user the option to change the length if they choose to. This means the program will offer them a choice of how many characters should be in their password. </p>
<p>It's great to see that you're thinking about this project and asking all the right questions. Good job. </p>
<p>Now I have another meeting to attend, so I'll head off. But if you need anything else, please don't hesitate to ask. Thank you again. </p><p class="desc">[The NSW Government and TAFE NSW logos appear on a grey background. The white letters of ‘TAFE NSW’ briefly flash blue.
